	<h1> Mia Teixeira </h1>
        <p>I'm Mia Teixeira (she/they), a computational linguist with 8 years of experience in experimental, theoretical, and corpus linguistics working with linguistics, computer science, and physics teams. My expertise and passion lies at the intersection of formal language theory, parsing and desgining formal grammars, machine learning, developing methods for interpretability of neural features, and data science. I thrive in collaborative and engaging environments where I can apply my knowledge of linguistic theory to improve engineering approaches to Natural Language.</p>
