    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm Mia Teixeira and I am a computational linguist with eight years of experience in experimental, theoretical, and corpus linguistics working with linguistics, computer science, and physics teams.</p>
    <p>My expertise and passion lies at the intersection of formal language theory, parsing and designing formal grammars, machine learning, developing methods for interpretability of neural features, and data science.</p>
    <p>I thrive in collaborative and engaging environments where I can apply my knowledge of linguistic theory to improve engineering approaches to Natural Language.</p>
